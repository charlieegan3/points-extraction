%% For citations, I would recommend natbib for its

%% The natbib package gives you the following definitons

%   \citet{key} ==>>                Jones et al. (1990)
%   \citet*{key} ==>>               Jones, Baker, and Smith (1990)

%   \citep*{key} ==>>               (Jones, Baker, and Smith, 1990)
%   \citep[chap. 2]{key} ==>>       (Jones et al., 1990, chap. 2)
%   \citep[e.g.][]{key} ==>>        (e.g. Jones et al., 1990)

%% It is useful to split the document up as chapters and include
%% them.  LaTeX will sort out all the numbering and cross-referencing
%% for you --- if you run it enough times!

%% If you want to include only a couple of chapters then use the
%% \includeonly{} command with a list of the file/chapter names that
%% you wish to include.  NB, this must be in the preamble.

%% This will make sure that all cross-references are correct (including
%% references to those file not included) but will produce a dvi
%% file with only those files/chapters you specify included.

\begin{abstract}
  With an ever increasing number of internet users, online communities are hosting a ever growing number of discussions. This user generated content contains millions of statements, opinions and ideas. Current systems for discovery of such information are playing catch-up and in the meantime much of this resource is all but inaccessible.

  In this paper an approach for summarizing such information is proposed. Our approach is based on the idea of `point extraction', where a point is a verb and it's associated arguments. We implement and test our approach on six online debates before evaluating our summaries against a baseline. We found that we were able to improve significantly on a statistical extractive baseline.
