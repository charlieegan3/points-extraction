\chapter{Research Goals\label{chap:requirements}}

  H1: our tool produces more readable summaries than a simple, statistical, bag-of-words, baseline, extractive summarizer.
  H2: the layout \& explanation of summary content is valuable to the readability of summaries
  H3: for given points in the discussion, our tool selects good extracts to represent them.

  \section{Functional Requirements}
    To be elaborated
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Extraction of points from raw text.}
      \item{All dependencies of the verb are correctly extracted as part of the point}
      \item{A clustering mechanism for identifying contrastive points}
      \item{An interface to inspect the content of a discussion}
      \item{Implement independent components to enable reuse in the analysis pipeline}
      \item{Capable of handling large discussions}
      \item{Use standard data formats for communication between pipeline components}
    \end{itemize}
