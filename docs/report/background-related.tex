  \section{Background}
    This project is built on existing technologies and research. This section gives an overview of the key foundations.

    \subsection{Summarization}
      ``A summary can be loosely defined as a text that is produced from one or more texts, that conveys important information in the original text(s), and that is no longer than half of the original text(s) and usually significantly less than that.'' \cite{radev2002introduction}

      Approaches to summarization could be grouped loosely into two groups, extractive and abstractive. Extractive summaries are constructed using content found in the source text. Abstractive summaries generate the summary content by performing some form of analysis on the source text. One might also group summarization tasks based on the nature of the source text. Approaches tend to summarize either single or multiple documents.

      This project is more closely related to the summarization of multiple documents, however, it applies both elements of extraction and abstraction.

    \subsection{Argument Mining}
      Argumentation Mining is a task that involves identifying components of arguments within text such as premises and the conclusion. Part of the task often involves fitting these into a template or known pattern to enable some level of reasoning.
