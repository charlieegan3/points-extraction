B did not have that problem because that summary started multiple sentences with God. That is also part of the reason that both Organization and Readability were better in the A summary.
Overall B was somewhat repetitive. A used some logical flow to this summary, but also tended to be slightly repetitive. The final determiner for me was the excellent use of categories, plus the bullet point concept that A used. The (X) and (Y) were a distraction, but still not enough to swing my opinion.","same","layout-better","layout-better","layout-better","layout-better","Personally the organization aspects for both of these is poor. The punctuation on option A is awful, which is part of the reason for the opinion on readability. So many errors really steals the readability, so these two categories can be attached in that sense.

B only rated as better, although really close to getting a ""much better"" rating. If B had grouped a couple of the individual lines into a well constructed sentence, this would have been a slam dunk for B.","plain-better","same","plain-better","plain-much_better","plain-much_better"
